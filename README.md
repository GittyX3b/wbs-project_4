Set up a new React app using Vite, with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI. Refer to our Our Basic Setup Guide in the course materials for step-by-step instructions.

Use DaisyUI components to quickly scaffold the UI.

The website should include the following pages:

Destinations/:slug

About (Information about the company)

Contact (Simple contact form (no submission logic required))

On the Home page:

Display a search bar with criteria such as origin, destination, dates, etc.

When the Search button is clicked, navigate to the Destinations page.

On the Destinations page:

Hard-code a list of travel destination cards (e.g. country or city previews), use slugs as identifiers.

You may use Pexels or Unsplash for free stock photos.

Be sure to review the individual artist’s licence agreement before using their images.

On the Destinations/:slug page:

Retrive the information about that particular destination based on the slug.
